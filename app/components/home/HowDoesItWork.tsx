          To use our website, simply enter the mobile number you want to learn
          more about. You can then read comments, ratings, and complaints from

          When you search for a mobile number on our website, we will first
          check to see if there is an existing entry for that number. If there
          is, you will be able to read the comments, ratings, and complaints
          that have been submitted by other users. You can also add your own
          comments and ratings.

        <p className="mt-5 font-[Electronic] text-xl">
          If there is no existing entry for the mobile number you searched for,
          we will create a new entry for you. This means that you will be the
          first person to add comments, ratings, and complaints about that
          number. Your comments and ratings will be valuable to other users who
          are searching for the same number in the future.

          As more and more people use our website, it will become an even more
          valuable resource. The more comments, ratings, and complaints that we
          have, the better equipped we will be to help people make informed
          decisions about who they call.

        <p className="mt-5 font-[Electronic] text-xl">
          We believe that our website has the potential to be a major platform
          for helping people make informed decisions about who they call. We are
          committed to making our website a safe and welcoming environment for
          everyone, and we hope that you will join our community.
